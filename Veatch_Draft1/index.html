        <h1 id="Intro">Introduction</h1>   
        <p>Indigenous Peoples’ literacies have been underrepresented in the academic world in the past, to the point of inexistence. This research came out of my own acknowledgement of that underrepresentation. I realized that as a member of the academic institution in America, I had little exposure to Native American literature. Furthermore, the exposure I did have with Native American literature had a small role in my academic understanding of literacy. With the expanding view of literacy forms, unacknowledging literacies of Indigenous groups in America is a disservice to those groups and to our understanding of literacy history and learning. Native groups held, and still hold, to strong traditions of oral literacies in the form of storytelling and history.</p>
            <p>Today, those oral literacies have transformed into written literacies. These written literacies often take the form of creative writing which blends traditions of oral literacy with written literacy. For Indigenous groups in America, creative writing was a way for them to bridge the gap between Native cultures and American academics. The introduction of and popularity of Native American Literature gave power, authority, and voice to indigenous groups into an area where they were voiceless. Recently, more studies and recovery projects have been done to draw awareness to the issues surrounding teaching Native American Literature through the white gaze, and to integrate more Native American Literature appropriately into academic areas of American society. This research will cover a brief history of Native American literacy history before discussing Native American Literature courses and the changes needed to for these courses to have appropriate and authentic representation of Native American literacy. It is not my intention to provide a comprehensive history of Native American literature and literacy, but rather form an argument on how creative writing outlets gave literacy validation to Indigenous groups in American, and this validation needs to be carried into American academics in order to perpetuate a cycle of appropriate representation of Native American literacy for American students. </p>
        <h1 id="Boarding Schools">Boarding Schools for Indigenous Peoples</h1>
            <p>In the late nineteenth century and continuing into the twentieth century, the United States government and churches created what are called ‘Native American Boarding Schools.’ The sole purpose of these boarding schools was to assimilate Native American children into Western culture. Boarding schools would strip Native American children of their cultural traditions by forcing them to dress, act, and learn Western values. On many occasions, the process of assimilation included degrading remarks from the instructors on the students and their culture. On the “Native Words, Native Warriors” page dedicated to Native American involvement in World War II, there is a page specifically mentioning the “Boarding School Tragedy.” The page goes on to briefly mention what assimilate looked like at these boarding schools, only taking three sentences to mention the positive outcomes of the institutions [americanindian.si.edu]. However, Julie Davis, author of “American Indian Boarding School Experiences,” does not understate the irony of those boarding schools. Davis spends her article discussing various books written by those with Native American boarding school experience, or else with ties to one with such experience. She uses her comments to provide focus on the different experiences Native students had in these boarding schools. One “fundamental conclusion” she had was that boarding school histories are ‘complex’ stating,</p>
                <p>Boarding schools embodied both victimization and agency for Native people, and they served as sites of both cultural loss and cultural persistence. These institutions, intended to assimilate Native people into mainstream society and eradicate Native cultures, became integral components of American Indian identities and eventually fueled the drive for political and cultural self-determination in the late twentieth century. (Davis, 20).</p>  
            <p>Indeed, going on Davis describes how although the boarding schools were responsible for the “cultural assault” of Native American children, this assault pushed the children and parents as well as school friends to cleave closer together, thus solidifying familial bonds and traditional values. Students comment that they made lasting friendships at these boarding schools. One way in which familial bonds grew stronger was through letters parents would write to their children and vice versa. Naturally, these letters were a form of written literacy, a Western literacy adoption used against the Western agenda. It is additionally ironic that boarding schools not only worked against their purpose of separating Native children from their tribal cultures, but the literacies learned within the boarding schools would later be used to provide more authority and cultural validation for Native Americans. As Davis says, “…far from eradicating traditional cultures, boarding school experiences actually facilitated cultural persistence in a number of unintended ways.” (Davis, 21). Unintended to be sure, but the combination of oral literacies with written literacies certainly added to the emergence of Native American literature.  </p>
        <h1 id="NAL">Emergence of Native American Literature</h1>
            <p>This is my second body section. In this section I plan to discuss the emergence of Native American Literature into American popular culture. I will also discuss the 'Native American Literture Renaissance' and bring in some interviews from Alexie and others.</p>
            <p>Native American fiction appeared in the 1930’s, following the Stock Market Crash and the emergence of the most widespread drought in America. Priscella Oaks mentions in her article…</p>
            <p>[Correlation between influx of NA creative writing and Western genre]</p>
             <p>It was called the ‘Renaissance’ of Native American Literature. In the 1970’s a spring of creative writing was published by Native American authors. This was a second wave of Native American fiction writers. [Sherman Alexie interview] </p>
        <h1 id="NAL Courses">Native American Literature Courses</h1>
            <p>Native American Literature courses have had a space in academics for several decades. Either in the form of ‘Ethnic Literature’ or ‘Native American Literature.’ However, many of these courses have been deemed inappropriate by Native Americans or members of the Indigenous communities in North America because of the misunderstanding and offensive tones and/or stereotypes often present in such courses. Joseph Bruchac, an Abenaki descendent and professor of ethnic literature, started teaching NAL in 1970 in New York. In his article, “Four Directions: Some Thoughts on Teaching Native American Literature,” Bruchac describes the elements of NAL that he finds problematic. In describing a conversation he had with other professors teaching NAL he wrote,</p>
               <p> One of the people said that he was having a hard time finding texts. Another said that…he had some misgiving about the accuracy of the translations, though he didn’t know enough to know for sure how good they were. The third teacher…mentioned taking a course in how to teach Native American literature from a certain professor…the few Native American students on campus had signed up for the course but all dropped it because they found something objectionable about it. No one knew what. (Bruchac, 3)</p>
               <p> The difficulty was that NAL was becoming popular in universities, but the professors the universities got to teach the courses were not qualified to teach them. Bruchac also writes, </p>
                <p>The [totality of ‘Native American Literature’] comes out of (in just the area now called the continental United States) more than 400 different languages and distinct cultures….Yet, without any special preparation, without any read grounding in the cultures which produced those many literatures, without any familiarity with the languages from which they were translated…teachers on the university (and even high school) level are expected to teach this ‘native American Literature.’ Not only that, most of those teachers have never visited a Native American community or spoken with a singer Native American. (Bruchac, 4)</p>
                <p>The main issue for Bruchac is that NAL courses were being taught by professors who did not come from a background of Indian studies or Native American culture, and were therefore unable to appropriately teach such classes. It was not only their lack of cultural knowledge that made them inappropriate choices for instructors, it was also the fact that they were not knowledgeable in what made the literature they taught appropriate for the course. It is difficult to decide what literature to include on the reading list in any class, much less one that holds multiple literatures from multiple cultures being condensed into one semester course broadly described as ‘Native American Literature.’ It is even more difficult if the one choosing the literature is not well versed in Native American literatures, cultures, or languages. </p>
                <p> Such difficulties were analyzed by Patrice Hollrah in her article, “Sherman Alexie’s Challenge to the Academy’s Teaching of Native American Literture.” In this article, Hollrah uses Alexie’s book, Indian Killer, to analyze Alexie’s commentary on teaching NAL through the protagonist, Marie. In the book Marie argues with her professor over the reading list, first stating that one author’s claims to a Cherokee ancestry were false, and second that the autobiographies listed were co-written by white men (Hollrah, 28). Hollrah claims Marie’s objection is a projection of Alexie’s objection to the literature being taught in NAL courses. Hollrah writes, “the determining factor for a Native American literature reading list is that the text represent an ‘authentic’ Native American perspective, one that only ‘authentic’ Indians can deliver.” (Hollrah, 29). In this case, an appropriate NAL course cannot happen without a reading list of appropriately ‘authentic’ texts told from ‘authentic’ Native American perspectives. </p>
                <p>However, texts are not the only problematic element of NAL university courses. As Annette Portillo states in her article, “Indigenous-Centered Pedagogies,” one of the more prevalent issues she finds in her NAL courses are “students’ unwillingness to move beyond their assumptions about specific disciplines.” (Portillo, 156). </p>
                
        <h1 id="Recovery">Recovery Work</h1>
            <p>This is my fourth body section. In this section I will discuss the work being done in and out of the academy to fix the issues previously mentioned. I will discuss the various studies and recovery work being done throughout the country for Native American literacy and literature. </p>
            <p>While there have been several elements of NAL courses that are problematic, several Native American educators have done their best to rectify the issues in NAL courses.</p>
        <h1 id="Con">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>This is my conclusion. In this section I will sum-up my points, restate my thesis, and provide concluding thoughts to my research.</p>
