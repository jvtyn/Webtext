            <p>As stating in my introduction, I became interested in learning more about Native American literature when I realized that I hadn't had much exposure to it. In one of my footnotes I mention that I had only read two works by two Native American writers during my college career. When the opportunity to explore Native American writing came about, I jumped on it. Learning more about Native American creative writing was not only interesting and educational, but it opened up a new avenue of study. As a teacher, I was exceedingly interested in the ways other Native teachers were introducing students to their literacy history. Although I am not of Native descent, reading about the teaching experiences of Native scholars and writers holds many lessons to others on how they can use their histories, passions, and experiences to teach and validate other voices in the classroom.</p>
